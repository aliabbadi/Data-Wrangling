Data Engineering & Cleaning: Conducted end-to-end data acquisition from disparate sources. Ensured data integrity by meticulously handling quality issues, including managing missing values and structural inconsistencies. This was achieved using robust Python libraries such as Pandas (for cleaning and manipulation), io and zipfile (for handling data streams and compressed files), and os (for file system interaction).
